Git Commands
-------------
Rebase feature branch with develop:
git checkout develop 
git pull origin develop -> this fetches the remote version of the develop branch and merges it (or rebases it, depending on your pull strategy) into/onto your local branch. This way the local and the remote versions of develop are the same 
git checkout feature-brach 
git rebase develop
git push origin feature-branch-name --force

Squash Commit :

$ git rebase -i HEAD~4 (4 is the number of commits to be squashed)
* At the interactive screen that opens up, replace “pick” with “squash” at the top for all the commits that you want to squash, except first commit. 
* Save and close the editor through esc --> :wq 
Push to the remote using:
$ git push origin branch-name --force
